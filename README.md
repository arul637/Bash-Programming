<h1>Bash Programming</h1>
<ul>
  <li> Bash scripting is used to automate repetitive tasks and streamline complex processes on Unix-like operating systems.</li>
  <li>Bash scripts are essential for system administrators to manage configurations, perform backups, and carry out routine maintenance tasks in a command-line environment.</li>
</ul>

<h2>SheBang!!</h2>
<h3 align='center'>#! /bin/bash</h3>
<p>The shebang line in a Bash script specifies the path to the Bash interpreter.</p>
<p>The shebang <b>(#! /bin/bash)</b> at the beginning tells the system to interpret the script using the Bash shell. The second line is a comment, and it's optional but good practice for clarity.</p>
